# Opening questions

These are some possible questions to use at the beginning of a storytelling
session to ease into the story, give some color to the participants, or
otherwise break the ice. Please do not feel limited to these questions!

* What was your first experience with / memory of a computer (or other
technology)?
* What is your favorite movie?
* What was the first computer (or video) game you played?
* What brings you joy at the moment?
* What is your most exciting project or hobby right now?
* What's a skill you picked up during your career that has nothing to do with your job?
* What is your favorite text editor?
* If someone were watching a movie about you, what is your movie's title and tagline?
